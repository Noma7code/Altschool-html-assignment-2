    <!--Biography-->
    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
      I am a tech enthusiast eager to kickstart my journey in software
      development, particularly in backend engineering. My interest in
      technology began with curiosity about how websites and applications
      function behind the scenes. While I have little to no formal experience in
      programming, I am determined to learn and master the core concepts of
      backend development.
    </p>
    <p>
      As someone new to tech, I have started exploring programming with Python
      and JavaScript. I believe that structured learning, hands-on projects, and
      mentorship will help me grow into a proficient backend developer. Over
      time, I have developed a deep curiosity for backend development,
      databases, and cloud computing, as well as how they power modern
      applications.
    </p>

    <!--Why Altschool Africa-->
    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
    <p>
      I joined AltSchool Africa to gain hands-on experience in software
      engineering and expand my knowledge in backend engineering. The structured
      curriculum and mentorship opportunities at AltSchool provide the perfect
      environment to enhance my technical and problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my main motivations for joining this program is its practical
      approach to learning. AltSchool focus on real-world applications,
      industry-relevant projects, and career-building opportunities will be of

    <!--Goals for the program-->
    <h2>Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My primary goal is to become a skilled backend engineer capable of
        building scalable and efficient server-side applications. I want to gain
        expertise in programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, as
        well as frameworks like Django and Node.js.
      </li>
      <li>
        I aim to develop a strong understanding of databases (SQL and NoSQL),
        API development, and cloud computing. These skills will enable me to
        work on complex backend systems and contribute to real-world
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        I want to develop a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms,
        and databases, which are essential for backend engineering.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the end of the program, I hope to have built a portfolio of backend
        projects that showcase my skills. I also plan to participate in
        open-source contributions, collaborate with other learners, and
        eventually secure a role as a backend developer.
